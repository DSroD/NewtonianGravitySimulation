Numerical simulation of 2D solar system based on Newtonian mechanics.
Initial planet positions and velocities are based on VSOP87 computation on 2018 Jan 1 12:00 UT1, moon initial positions are not based on real data,
but only on average distance from its parent planet and average orbiting velocity.
